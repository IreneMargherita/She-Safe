# She-Safe
This project aims to address violence against women. Our prototype is the simulation of IoT based application which sends the location details and information of the victim to the concerned authorities and her guardians at the time the button has been pressed. The project has been simulated using NODE- RED. This project was made complete using 3 rd Party nodes downloaded from the node-red palette. More information has been given on them in section 3 System Design. Due to the Lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic, the IOT Simulation of the project only has been done.
